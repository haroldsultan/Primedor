* **Mathematical Card Collections**: Collect cards featuring famous mathematicians and number theory concepts—Prime Numbers, Even & Odd Numbers, Perfect Squares, Fibonacci Sequences, and more.
* **Strategic Token System**: Manage a limited supply of mathematical tokens (Prime, Even, Odd, Square, Sequence, Perfect) to purchase cards and negotiate optimal trades.
* **Noble Mathematicians**: Claim the patronage of legendary mathematicians like Euclid, Pythagoras, and Hypatia by accumulating the right token combinations.
* **Flexible Gameplay**: Play with 2-4 players, adjust game speed (Slow, Normal, Fast), and customize player types (Human or AI).
* **Beautiful Polish**: Enjoy smooth animations, immersive sound effects, and background music for an engaging experience.
* **Real-time Feedback**: See card reveals, track player progress, and watch tokens flow as you build your mathematical empire.

## Gameplay

Each turn, players take one of four actions: collect tokens from the supply, buy a visible card using their tokens, reserve a hidden card for later, or pass. Build your token economy strategically, watch for valuable card combinations, and claim nobles to boost your prestige. The first player to accumulate enough prestige points wins!
